# 🔐 Credit Card Masking Mini Project

This mini project uses **string indexing** to hide all but the last 4 digits of a credit card number.

---

## 🧠  Key Concepts
->String indexing lets us pick parts of a string.

->“from the 4th character from the end, to the end.”

->This is useful for hiding sensitive info like credit card numbers.

```text
credit_card_number = "7654-3405-9284-1394"
```
### output
```text
xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-1394

```
